# Minitalk - 42 Project

## Introduction
Minitalk is a small but practical project that involves creating a server and client communication system using Unix signals. The goal is to send and receive messages between processes, utilizing the low-level concept of signals, which will allow you to dive deep into system programming and bitwise operations. This project teaches fundamental programming concepts like inter-process communication (IPC), signals, and bit manipulation in C.

__Learning Objectives__
Bitwise Operations: One of the key techniques used in this project is bitwise operations. Specifically, you manipulate individual bits of a character to represent data as a series of signals.

Signals: This project helps you understand how Unix signals work (specifically SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2) and how they can be used for inter-process communication.

Process Management: You'll also work with process IDs (PIDs) and use system calls like kill, pause, and signal to send and receive messages.

Memory Management: This project involves dynamic memory management, especially in managing strings and message buffers.

## How It Works

__Client Code__
The client sends a message to the server by converting each character in the message into bits. Each bit is sent as a signal to the server. The client works as follows:

Input: The client takes in the server's process ID (PID) and the message to send.

Send Signal: For each character in the message, the client breaks it into its 8 bits and sends each bit as a signal:

0 bit: Sends SIGUSR1.

1 bit: Sends SIGUSR2.

Wait for Acknowledgment: After sending the message, the client waits for an acknowledgment from the server.

__Server Code__
The server listens for incoming signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2). It works like this:

Signal Reception: The server waits for SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2. Each signal corresponds to a bit of the message.

Reconstruct Message: The server reconstructs the received message byte by byte, based on the incoming signals.

Display Message: When a full byte (8 bits) is received, the server displays the character on the screen. If a null byte ('\0') is received, it prints a newline and terminates the message.

__Bonus Features__
The bonus part of the project adds two features:

Acknowledgment: After receiving the complete message, the server sends a SIGUSR2 signal back to the client as an acknowledgment.

Null Byte: The client sends a special signal sequence to indicate the end of the message, represented by sending 8 consecutive SIGUSR1 signals.

## Code Breakdown
__Client:__
send_bit(pid, a): Sends each bit of the character a to the server.

main(): Reads the arguments, validates them, and sends the message bit by bit.

__Server:__
handle(): Listens for incoming signals and reconstructs the message byte by byte.

main(): Sets up the signal handlers and keeps the server running.

__Bonus Client:__
send_bit(pid, a): Same as the main client but with slightly reduced sleep time to improve message delivery speed.

send_null(pid): Sends 8 consecutive SIGUSR1 signals to indicate the end of the message.

handler_sig(): Waits for an acknowledgment from the server using SIGUSR2.

main(): Same as the client but with added acknowledgment handling.

__Bonus Server:__
handle(): Similar to the main server but also sends a signal back to the client for acknowledgment.

main(): Waits for incoming signals using the bonus version of the signal handler.

__How to Compile__
To compile the project, use the following command:

```sh
make
```
This will create two executables: client and server.

__Running the Program__
Start the Server:

```sh
./server
```
Run the Client:

```sh
./client <server_pid> <message>
Replace <server_pid> with the server's PID and <message> with the message you want to send.
```

## Conclusion
The Minitalk project is an excellent exercise in understanding low-level systems programming and inter-process communication using signals. 
It helps you grasp essential concepts like bitwise operations, signal handling, and process management. 
By completing this project, youâ€™ll enhance your understanding of how processes communicate in Unix-like systems, preparing you for more advanced programming challenges in systems-level programming.
